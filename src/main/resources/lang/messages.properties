about-page.title=About
about-page.desc-intro=We love playing LARPs (live action role-playing game) and enjoy their organisation too. \
  However, there are several activities which must be done, but are repetitive and boring. One of them is also assigning characters to players.
about-page.desc-purpose=Moirai is an application which is intended to help automate this activity. \
  It supports two different approaches of player question forms. It has also several configuration options to satisfy \
  as much different games as possible.
about-page.desc-contact=Please, let us know if you miss any configuration option, every feedback is welcome. \
  The project is developed as an open source and is provided free of charge. Feel free to check the repository or even create a pull request.
