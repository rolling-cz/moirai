about-page.title=About
about-page.desc-intro=We love playing LARPs (live action role-playing game) and enjoy their organisation too. \
  However, there are several activities which must be done, but are repetitive and boring. One of them is also assigning characters to players.
about-page.desc-purpose=Moirai is an application which is intended to help automate this activity. \
  It supports two different approaches of player question forms. It has also several configuration options to satisfy \
  as much different games as possible.
about-page.desc-contact=Please, let us know if you miss any configuration option, every feedback is welcome. \
  The project is developed as an open source and is provided free of charge. Feel free to check the repository or even create a pull request.

faq-page.title=FAQ
faq-page.question.1=How does assignment work?
faq-page.answer.1=Based on the user configuration, player satisfaction can be calculated for each possible character allocation. \
  The application tries to find the allocation with the highest overall satisfaction.
faq-page.question.2=Does the application manage the selection of the players who'll participate in the game?
faq-page.answer.2=No, the application assumes that the selection of players has already taken place and that all the specified players will participate in the game. \
  For this reason, you need to enter the same number of players as characters.
faq-page.question.3=What is the satisfaction rating function?
faq-page.answer.3=The application needs to be able to compare whether one character distribution is better than another. That is achieved by the calculation \
  of each player's satisfaction with the characters they have been assigned. For example, how satisfied will a player be with his most preferred character or, \
  conversely, with the character that has the maximum the combat content of the game when they don't care about the fight.
faq-page.question.4=What is the character form type approach?
faq-page.answer.4=This is one of the two style options for the registration form. The organizers will publish a list of all characters \
  at the game, including a brief info about them. In the registration form, players select a few characters (typically three) they would like to play. \
  Sometimes they enter characters that they definitely don't want to play, too. For some games, the order in which the characters are entered is also important.
faq-page.question.5=In general, how is the character assignment done for the character form type approach?
faq-page.answer.5=The assignment score is calculated based on the preferred characters that players filled in their questionnaires. \
  The order of the preferred characters or/and the characters that are completely unwanted, may play a role.
faq-page.question.6=What is the content form type approach.
faq-page.answer.6=This is one of two style options for the registration form. The organizers identify several characteristics \
  of the game content, such as combat, romance, faith, etc. Each character is described using these characteristics, \
  in other words, how much the player will encounter these characteristics if they play as them. In the form itself, players describe\
  what content they would like to play by using the same characteristics.
faq-page.question.7=In general, how is the character assignment done for the content form type approach?
faq-page.answer.7=Application calculates a satisfaction for each possible player character assignment. This is done by comparing \
  player's desired characteristics and the character's characteristics. The organizers set characteristic importance to the players' satisfaction. \
  They can also set the magnitude of the difference between the desired value of the trait versus that of the assigned character. \
  That is, if a player requesting combat 1 will be much more unhappy with a character with combat 5 than one with combat 3.
faq-page.question.8=How does the application work with gender?
faq-page.answer.8=Each character must have specified a gender, the possible options are male (MALE), female (FEMALE), or both (AMBIGUOUS). \
  AMBIGUOUS gender is meant for characters, which has both male and female versions or it doesn't matter. \
  Players then define which gender they would like to play. The options are male (MALE), female (FEMALE) and doesn't matter (AMBIGUOUS). \
  The application therefore does not address the gender of players at all, only the preferred gender of their characters. From the satisfaction calculation, \
  the unwanted gender means the character's gender and the preferred gender are different and neither value is both/any (AMBIGUOUS).
faq-page.question.9=What is the purpose of multiple character selection or so called pre-selection?
faq-page.answer.9=The games with higher number of players can benefit from two-step assignment. In the first step, players choose the preferred game content\
  by the content form type approach. The algorithm selects multiple suitable characters for each, typically two or three, \
  and these so-called pre-selections are sent to the players along with a short description of the characters. \
  In the second step, players ranked their pre-selected characters and this input is processed by the character approach algorithm. \
  The advantage of two-step character selection is less time-consuming registration form and the possibility to choose a character \
  according its description at the same time.
faq-page.question.10=Can I use the app to divide players into groups?
faq-page.answer.10=Currently, the app does not support grouping, you always need to have defined characters. \
  In the case of a content from type approach, the possible workaround is to convert each group to the appropriate number of characters, \
  that will have the same properties and just a different name. Unfortunately, there is no such option for character approach.
